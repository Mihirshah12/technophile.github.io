<h1>HOVERBOARD</h1>
<pre><strong>
The coolest toy available in the market...This funky electronic skatebaord will hover you around at almost 15 km/h. To add to its cool quotient it also has

- Trippy blue LED lights

- An efficient rechargeable lithium battery from Samsung, which charges in 2 hours and gives you many hours of use

- Can take upto 100 kgs of load and still glide around smoothly

Cautionary Note: Just like riding a bicycle or skate boarding or roller blading the hoverboard works on the simple principle of balance. So its going to require some amount of patience and practise before you can glide around like a pro. Also please put on the safety gear provided to ensure safety. EazyLeazy will not assume responsibility for any accident/injury caused. 

This hoverboard costs over Rs. 27,000. But you can get the hoverboard for as little as:

Rs. 1,450 minimum rental up to 48 hours
Rs. 3,100 for a week


Refundable deposit: Rs. 3,000 only. 
All prices are inclusive of delivery and prorated for the exact amount of days you rent
